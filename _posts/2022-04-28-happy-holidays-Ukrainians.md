The picture of woman slapping a man with a brunch shows how deversants are treated in Ukraine. Since 24th February happened, a lot of Russia supporters were giving information about Ukranian troops, or crowded places to Russian military.
As soon as those people were found they were tied up to a tree and their pants were taken of. Ferbuary and March are one of coldest monthes in a year, so you can only imagine how they felt. 
The meme was posted during a week prior to Easter, Palm Sunday. In Ukraine people follow the tradition of slightly slapping each other with willow brunches that were baptized before in church. It is believed that such a gentle slap will bring a person health and happiness. Important to add, that during this "slaps" people say special words "Not me beating you, but willow bits you, Easter is not far away". The first words of this phrase is written on the meme.
