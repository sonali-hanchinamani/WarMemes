Since invasion started, a lot of people who were not taken to army started to search ways to help Ukrainian army in any possible way. Some started to collect humanitarial aid, some cooked meals for refugees and teritorial defence etc. But some, especially those who knew how to use computer, wanted to bring light on what is happening to russians. At first people tried "human" ways: explaining the situation, showing videos and pictures of bombing. But after discovering, that a lot of people actually support the war, Ukranians started not only to text Russians with horrible pictures of crimes their country did, but also followed tutorials provided by programmers on how to do ddos attacks.
