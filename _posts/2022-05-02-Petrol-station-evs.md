This screenshot was taken during Eurovision Song Contest 2022 in May 2022. Basically, the host wanted to give high five to Ukrane representative Kalush, singer was also reaching out to him, but at it was too long for the show timeline, host gave up and moved on.  

Very similar situation happened to Ukranian petrol stations. They wanted to deliver their services to Ukrainians as long as possible, but ran out of gas (petrol). This was caused by few factors: Russians bombing patrol tanks, most people using cars to evaculate, prices getting higher because of deficit.

As for 1 July, this problem is solved and petrol stations on non-occupied teritories funcion as usual.
