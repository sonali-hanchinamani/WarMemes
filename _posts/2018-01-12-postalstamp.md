This may not be a meme in the original sense, but the story behind it is still rather interesting ( and they could be made the argument that the stamp is a meme itself now ).

The stamps gained popilarity because they are sold in limited amount. They can not be bought online, but only in person causing long queues in Ukraine's largest cities.

The scene portraited on the stamp tells the real-life story that happened in Ukraine after the invasion of Russian Federation. The Snake Island is an Ukrainian military base located in the Black Sea. It serves an important role in defending territorial waters. 

On the first day of Russian invasion, two Russian naval warships (Vasily Bykov and Moskva) attacked Snake Island. Upon receiving a transmission from one of the Russians warships requesting to surrender and threatening bombardment, an Ukrainian border guard responded "Russian warship, go fuck yourself!". This exchange gained worldwide attention and became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.

Later that day, Russian forces captured the Island. On 26th February 22, Ukrainian authorities announced the civilian search-and-rescue ship Sapphire had been seized by the Russian Navy.

Update. Since the stamp was published, the situation changed. Warship Moskva was hit with two R-360 Neptune anti-ship missiles and sank. A new stamp was published, saying "Russian warship THE END".  
On June 30th, Ukraine stated that the Russian forces have been pushed off the Island, whereas Russia announced it had withdrawn troops in a "gesture of good will".
