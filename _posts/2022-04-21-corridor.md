Air raid alarm is something, people don't really get used to. But it seems, Ukranians found their solutions to it.
This meme translates as "When you know how to prepare for air raid alarm". (Wine, bread sticks and cheese).

You may ask why the oicture is taken in bathroom. Well, it is a known fact that suding possible missile hiting a building, nobody is safe, but there are a bit less percentage that in the rooms that have no windows, it can be a bit more safe. 
That's why people relocate to corridors and bathrooms during sirens. If this small percentage can cost person's life, why not to try to keep it?
