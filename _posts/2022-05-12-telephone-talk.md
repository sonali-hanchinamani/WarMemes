On the meme above you can see two man. One of them is worldwide known President of France Emanuel Macron and the other man is mostly known in Ukraine. Its Vitaliy Kim. He is and the head of the regional military administration in the embattled southern city of Mykolaiv. His optimism and true devotion to Ukrainian nation gained him popularity and respect. The original picture of him sitting in his cabinet, was taken during one of the first sirens and missle shootings after 24th February. 
Emanuel Macron in Ukraine is mostly known for having long conversations with President of Russia, Vladimir Putin. This meme gives a hint that Vitaliy kim could be better at negotiations and Macron should listen to it.
