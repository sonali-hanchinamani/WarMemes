 9th may is a day known in Russia as the celebration of Victory over Nazis in WW2. It is a tradition to make a big parade with an idea of showing off in front of the whole world and hype up the proudness in it's citizens.

> This year, 2022, it was planned to make a parage again, but not enourmous as all recent years. 
This caused a big number of jokes among Ukranians, for several reasons that are obvious. 
The cherry on top was aviation show. At first, it was anounces that the aviation show will happen and people were waiting for it. Few hours before parade it was stated that aviation show was canceled due to "weather conditions". 

The meme explains what weather condition caused the cancelation of aviation show. The argument that this meme is rather true fact then just a meme is the picture taken during parade, it was absolutely normal.
