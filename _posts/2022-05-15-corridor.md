Air raid alarm is not something you usually get used to. But it seems that Ukrainians found their solutions to it.  

You may wonder why this photo is taken in a bathroom. Authorities recommend hiding in a window-less room as soons as an air alarm starts, since those rooms tend to be safer in case of missile hitting. So people usually wait in corridors and bathrooms till the alarm is over.
