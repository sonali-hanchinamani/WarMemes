Angelina Jolie visited Lviv in late April in her role as United Nations special envoy for refugees. Jolie is well known for her acting roles in many movies, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) among other things. As Lara Croft she obtains ancient artifacts from old gravesites. 

Around the time she visited Ukraine, Ukrainians celebrate Dead Easter (Навський Великдень). Ukrainians clean their dead relatives’ graves and bring Easter bread (Paska) and coloured eggs (Krashankas).
Naturally, Ukrainians joked about Jolie’s visit, titling the picture of her as Tomb Raider: “International Legion - Recruitment”.
