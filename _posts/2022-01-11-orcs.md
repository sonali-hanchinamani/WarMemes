After the invasion of the Ukraine, Russian soldiers are being called Orcs. To the Ukrainians the invaders resembled a savage, angry horde, they didn’t look like an army  or even humans at all. Exactly like J. R. R. Tolkien described the Orcs in his best-selling Lord of The Rings.
However, Tolkiens Orcs weren’t born evil. They essentailly were the same as the elves, but happened to fall into the wrong hands, being subjected to torture and as a result of that became the savage beings we know them as. There have been instances of Orcs defying the orders of commanders as well as Suaron and Saruman, so they must still have some free will and morals - so is it really impossible for Russian Soldiers  to reconsider their actions? 

There is a lot more about the analogy, it’s worth checking out: https://uacrisis.org/en/orcs-and-men
