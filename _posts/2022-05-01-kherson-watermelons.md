Literal translation of the meme above:
Ukrainians: "We want watermelons from Kherson!"
Ukrainiam Armed Forces: "Say no more, we are only 15 km from it"

> The Ukrainian city of Kherson is famous, first and foremost, for its huge sweet, watermelons. Starting in August, mountains of Kherson watermelons pop up across Ukraine: at the bazaars, in the supermarkets, even at roadside stands. 

As of 15th June, Ukrainian Armed forces were able to do several counter attacks and get closer to Kherson. Because of that, the meme was created, as if the army did that because people want watermelons.

Important to mention that a lot of people mentioned that they are sure that watermelons this season will be extremely tasty because they had perfect soil, rich with russians.
