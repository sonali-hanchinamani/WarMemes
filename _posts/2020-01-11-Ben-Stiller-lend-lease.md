On 9th May 2022, Biden signed "Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022" into law. The act authorizes to lend or lease military equipment to Ukraine. The last time America signed a lend-lease was in World War II to supply Great Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations with food, oil, and military equipment such as warships and warplanes  between 1941 and 1945, thus ending America’s neutrality.
Understandably, Ukraine put lots of hope into the arrival of new weaponry. 
Just weeks after the lend lease agreement was signed, Ben Stiller visited Kiev and met with President Zelensky. Ukrainians joked that the actor came as part of the lend lease and fight on the front-lines, just like his character in “Tropic Thunder” did.
