This meme is dedicated to two major historical events that took place recently. 
First, EU gave a candidate status to Ukraine. Ukrainians always wanted to be a part of big EU family, so the decision was welcomed very happily by Ukrainian nation.
Second, Borsch, Ukrainian traditional dish, was  added to Unesco endangered heritage list. Right now, there are more jokes around it , that if the woman prepared it not tasty, she is actually harming Unesco heritage item.

>Unesco said the war in Ukraine had "threatened" the cooking of borsch.

"Victory in the war for borsch is ours!" Ukraine's Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko said.
