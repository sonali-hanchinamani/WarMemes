On May 9th Russia celebrates Victory Day to commemorate its victory over Nazy Germany.  Following the signing of the German Instrument of Surrender late in the evening on 08 May 1945 only, the Soviet government announced the victory early on 9 May after the signing ceremony in Berlin. The day became a non-labour day in 1965.

Victory Day Parades are held in various post-soviet nations such as Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, and until 2015, Ukraine.
Russophone populations in many countries celebrate the holiday regardless of its local status, organize public gatherings and even parades on this day. Some multilanguage broadcasting television networks translate the "Victory speech" of the Russian president and the parade on Red Square for telecasts for viewers all over the globe, making the parade one of the world's most watched events of the year.

Since Vladimir Putin's rise to power, the Russian government began promoting the prestige of the governing regime and history, and national holidays and commemorations became a source of national self-esteem. Victory Day in Russia has increasingly become a celebration in which popular culture plays a central role. The 60th and 70th anniversaries of Victory Day in Russia (2005 and 2015) became the largest popular holidays since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
This year,  Moscow cut Russiaâ€™s Air Force from several 2022 Victory Day Parades. The flight show was ostensibly cancelled due to weather, though the ground portion of the parade took place with good visibility and under only somewhat cloudy skies.
