Since invasion started, a lot of Ukrainians who weren't liable to military service started to search ways to help Ukrainian army in any way. Some started to collect humanitarial aid, others made home-cooked meals for refugees. Some, however, wanted to try to explain the thruth to Russians. Initially, people did that in good will by trying to explain the situation and shwoing videos and pictures of bombings. 

But after discovering that a lot of Russians actually support the war, the tone changed. Ukrainians started to spam Russians with horrible pictures of war crimes. Programmers also started offering tutorials on how to cyperattack Russians.
