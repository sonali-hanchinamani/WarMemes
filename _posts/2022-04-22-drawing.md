The painting is one of Russia’s most famous and controversial ones:  “Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on 16 November 1581” by Russian artist Ilya Repin. It shows the grief-stricken Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible holding his dying son, Ivan Ivanovich. Ivan the Terrible had dealt his son a fatal blow to the head in a fit of rage.
Ivan Ivanovich’s death had grave consequences for Russia, since it only left incompetent heirs to the throne. After Ivan the Terrible’s death, this unprepared son Feodor I took over. Following his death in 1584, Russia experienced the “Time of Troubles”, a time of political uncertainty, famine and war. 

The speech bubble reads: “One day off, so you can rest and then you’ll be sent to conquer Ukraine again”. Clearly drawing a parallel to the 16th century and predicting (and maybe more importantly self-inflicted) difficult times for Russia.
