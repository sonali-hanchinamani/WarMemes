This can be not originaly an Internet meme, but the story behind this stamp is at some point a meme and known almost everywhere.

NOTE: The popularity if this stamp also was gained because it's limited amount. People could not buy online, only by standing in queues in few biggest cities of Ukraine.

The scene portraited on the stamp tells a real-life story that happened after Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Snake Island is located in Black sea,and is a Ukrainian military base. It serves an important role in delimiting Ukrainian territorial waters. 

To avoid any further misunderstanding, the inforamtion below was taken from Wikipedia page.

On 24 February 2022, on the first day of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, two Russian naval warships Vasily Bykov and Moskva, attacked Snake Island. Upon receiving a transmission from one of the Russian naval warships requesting surrender or else threatening bombardment, a Ukrainian border guard responded, "Russian warship, go fuck yourself." The response gained worldwide attention and became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance.Later on the same day, Russian forces landed and captured the island. On 26 February 2022, Ukrainian authorities announced that the civilian search-and-rescue ship Sapphire had been seized by the Russian Navy off Snake Island.

Update. Since this stamp was published, major changes appeared. Warship Moskva was hit with two R-360 Neptune anti-ship missiles that led to the sinking of the warship. New stamp was published, with the phrase "Russian warship THE END".  
On 30 June 2022, Ukraine said that it had pushed Russian forces from the island; Russia announced that it had withdrawn troops from the island in a "gesture of goodwill" after military objectives were complete.
