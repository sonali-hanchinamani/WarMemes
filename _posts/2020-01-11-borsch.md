This meme is dedicated to two major historical events that happened recently. 
First, EU gave a candidate status to Ukraine. Ukrainians wanted to be a part of EU family for quite some time now, so the decision was gladly welcomed by the Ukrainian people.
Secondly, Borsch,a  traditional Ukrainian dish, was  added to Unesco endangered heritage list. 

Many Ukrainians joke, that if Borsch is not prepared well by someone, that person may end up harming the Unseco heritage item. 

Unesco said the war in Ukraine had "threatened" the cooking of borsch.

"Victory in the war for borsch is ours!" Ukraine's Culture Minister Oleksandr Tkachenko.
