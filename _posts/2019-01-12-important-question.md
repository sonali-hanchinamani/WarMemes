Yury Aleksandrovich Dud (Russian: Ю́рий Алекса́ндрович Дудь) is a Russian journalist and Youtuber. On his YouTube-Channel vDud he often interviews public figures from Russia and other Post-Soviet nations, he usually ends his interviews by asking his guests “Standing next to Putin, what would you say to him?”

After the invasion of Ukraine, the internet took this question and twisted it to “Standing next to Putin, what would you kill him with?”
He is known to be regime-critical. When he was awarded GQ Russia's Person of the Year prize, he used his acceptance speech to urge his colleagues to break the silence over police brutality, corruption, and election rigging (video in Russian here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpH44fCAJM4) . 

Following 2020’s  mass crackdown in Belarus on the media, the GUBOPiK (Main Directorate for Combating Organized Crime and Corruption of the MVD of the Republic of Belarus) labelled three videos on his channel as extremist in 2022. The videos were about stand-up comedian Slava Komissarenko, who fled Belarus and openly opposes the government of Alexander Lukashenko.

In December 2021, he published the documentary “Why They Torture in Russia” on his YouTube Channel, in which he interviewed victims of torture as well as human rights activists and organizations. 

In February 2022, after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Dud condemned the invasion and publicly called for Russian troops to be withdrawn from Ukraine. Dud described the invasion as an "imperial frenzy" that he doesn't want to be a part of. A complaint about his anti-war posts were filed to the Prosecutor-General of Russia's Office and Ministry of Justice, calling for Dud to be designated as a "foreign agent". On 15 April, Dud was designated by the Ministry of Justice as a "foreign agent". He left his country to continue working from Istanbul.
