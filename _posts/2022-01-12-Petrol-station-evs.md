This meme shows the host of this year's Eurovision Song Contest trying to give Ukraine's representatve Kalush a high-five. Even tough both reached out, they couldn't reach each other and the show carried on. 

Ukrainians joked how similar this situation was to their petrol shortage, Ukrainian gas stations wanted to offer their services as long as possible, but many people didn't end up getting gas after waiting hours in line.

The shortage was caused by a few factors: Russia bombing petrol tanks, people evacuating by car as well as prices increasing immensly. 

As for July 1st, the shortage is solved and gas stations in non-occupied territories function as ususal.
