The meme shows President Emmanuel Macron and Vitaliy Kim. Vitaliy Kim is the head of the regional military administration in the embattled southern city of Mykolaiv. His optimism and true devotion to the Ukrainian nation have gained him popularity and respect from the Ukrainian people. The original photo of him shows him sitting in his cabinet and was taken during the first sirens and missle shootings after the 24th February. 
Emanuel Macron mostly had long conversations with Vladimir Putin since the invasion started. This meme subtly suggests Macron should let Vitaliy Kim take the wheel and run negotiationsgives a hint that Vitaliy kim could be better at negotiations, since he might be better at it.
