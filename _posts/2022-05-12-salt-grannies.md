Artmensil is one of the biggest salt enterprises in the world. It extracts over 70% of the country's salt. 
But due to a heavy fighting in the Donbas, where the parts of the company's headquarters got destroyed, the enterprise stopped operating in April. The production process got impossible and they didn't want to endanger their people. 
Another reason was the fact that Artemsil is mainly focused on the shipment of products by rail. Only a small part could be exported by road. That's why even under normal circumstances it would not be possible to ship anything if the railway does not work.

Grannies, not only in Ukraine, but in many other countries are known for always storing more things that usually people would need. One of the reasons they do it, particularly in Ukraine is because of winter preparations: making so-called "conservations" (basically making pickles). Now, as the biggest salt enterprise was shot down, people can buy salt only very expensive. The joke here is that some grannies sell the salt for more money, and make "business".
