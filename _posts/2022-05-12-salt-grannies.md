Artmensil is one of the biggest salt enterprises in the world. It extracts over 70% of the country's salt. 
But due to a heavy fighting in the Donbas, where the parts of the company's headquarters got destroyed, the enterprise stopped operating in April. The production process got impossible and they didn't want to endanger their people. 
Another reason was the fact that Artemsil is mainly focused on the shipment of products by rail. Only a small part could be exported by road. That's why even under normal circumstances it would not be possible to ship anything if the railway does not work.

The older generation in Ukraine, not unlike Germany. like to prepare for the colder months by making "conservations"(basically making pickles), so they usually stock up on salt before winter. Therefore putting them in a good position to make some good money by selling some of their leftover salt.
