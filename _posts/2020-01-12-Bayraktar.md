The man in the picture is a famous Ukrainian TV-host Sergiy Prytula. Since February 24, 2022, Prytula has been coordinating a volunteer supply center for the Ukrainian Ground Forces and civilian volunteers during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

On June 22  2022, Prytula started  fundraising of 500 000 000 UAH for 3 Bayraktar TB2 for the  Ukrainian army. He  crowdfunded a 600 000 000 UAH in 3 days. The Turkish defense firm Baykar said it would donate three unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to Ukraine, after a crowdfunding campaign there raised enough funds to buy "several" Bayraktar TB2 models. Since then, Ukrainians joke that they can collect money for literally any kind of weaponry to be used against the Russian army, including The Death Star from Star Wars.
