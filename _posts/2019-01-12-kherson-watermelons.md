Literal translation :

Ukrainians: "We want watermelons from Kherson!"
Ukrainiam Armed Forces: "Say no more, we're only 15 km from it"

The Ukrainian city Kherson is famous, first and foremost, for its huge sweet, watermelons. Since August, piles of Kherson's watermelons pop up across Ukraine: at the bazaars, in supermarkets and at roadside stands. 

As of June 15th, Ukrainian Armed forces were able to run several counterattacks and got closer to Kherson. People joked, the army only wanted to get the territories back to get the Ukrainian people some watermelon.

"Fun fact": Ukrainians also joked that watermelons this year are guaranteed to be tasty, since the soil was perfect being rich with Russians".
